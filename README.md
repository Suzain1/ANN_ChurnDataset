🧠 Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Welcome to the Churn Prediction project! This repository contains a Python script that utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn based on various features.

⚙️ Features
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. Model Building: An Artificial Neural Network is built using Keras and TensorFlow.
3. Model Training: The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.
4. Prediction: The trained model is used to predict churn for new customer data.

🚀 Getting Started
